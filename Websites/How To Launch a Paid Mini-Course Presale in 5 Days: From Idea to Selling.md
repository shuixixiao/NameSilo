Last week, I attempted to launch a paid community for a small group of friends and a 30-person waitlist. The result? Zero sales.

I sat at my desk, refreshing my Stripe account in disbelief, staring at $0.00. It was embarrassing, especially considering I‚Äôve made over $3M in sales through affiliate marketing.

Where did I go wrong? The answer came when I decided to stop wallowing and gave it another shot. Over the next five days, I went from having no clue what course to create to launching a full presale landing page with a clear outline.

Here‚Äôs the exact 5-day method I used that you can replicate to launch your course successfully.

## Day 1: Define Your Audience

A common mistake in online selling is creating something first and then searching for people to buy it. Instead, start by identifying your audience and building something specifically for them.

In my failed attempt, I made my paid community too broad‚Äîtargeting writers, podcasters, and solopreneurs. It was vague and unfocused.

### Narrowing Down Your Audience
Use this simple process:
1. **Start broad**: Who do you want to help? (e.g., writers)
2. **Go specific**: What type of writers? (e.g., digital writers)
3. **Niche down further**: What type of digital writers? (e.g., long-form content writers)

For me, this niche‚Äîdigital writers focusing on long-form content‚Äîwas the sweet spot.

**Tip:** Keep niching down until you‚Äôre targeting a very specific audience.

## Day 2: Create Your Course Idea

If you have experience with your chosen audience, use that to solve a problem you‚Äôve faced yourself. The easiest way to design a course is by sharing your own expertise.

### My Example
As a digital writer since 2015 (full-time since 2017), my biggest struggle has been consistently writing enough content each week. Recently, I revamped my focus protocol, which helped me increase my output significantly‚Äîfrom writing one article a week to three in just one 90-minute session.

I realized this system would be valuable for writers struggling with procrastination and low productivity.

---

### Crafting Your Course Hook
Your course idea must communicate its value clearly. Start by answering these questions:
- **Who is it for?**
- **What problem does it solve?**

Here‚Äôs how I refined my pitch:
- **Initial idea**: If you procrastinate and publish less content, this course shows you how to train your brain to write more efficiently.
- **Final one-liner**: *Focus Protocol: Learn to write more articles in less time.*

**Pro Tip:** Keep refining until it‚Äôs simple, clear, and compelling.

## Day 3: Outline Your Course

You don‚Äôt need to create the full course right away, but you must know the steps it includes. Break it into actionable sections.

### My Course Outline
1. Introduction: Who I am and why this is important.
2. The Benefits: Why this course matters.
3. The Focus Protocol: The exact steps to improve writing output.
4. Tools for Success: Habits and tech tips.
5. Common Mistakes: What to avoid.
6. Bonus: Additional ideas for success.

A **mini-course** solves one specific problem for one specific audience. Keep it simple with a clear A-to-B approach.

### Highlight the Benefits
Focus on what your audience gains from your course. Move beyond features to benefits.

- **Feature**: Templates for tracking productivity.
- **Benefit**: Save time and stay organized to improve efficiency.

**Benefits of My Course**:
- Write more in less time.
- Build momentum and overcome overwhelm.
- Increase income by publishing more.
- Develop better habits for long-term success.

**In a nutshell**:
- Write faster.
- Earn more.
- Reduce stress.

These short, impactful benefits will drive conversions when added to your checkout page.

### Key Elements for Your Sales Page

2. **Benefits**: Highlight the outcomes your course delivers.
3. **Course Overview**: Provide a brief outline of what‚Äôs included.
4. **Call to Action (CTA)**: Encourage immediate action (e.g., ‚ÄúEnroll now!‚Äù).

By following these steps, you‚Äôll have a professional-looking sales page ready in no time.

## Day 5: Get Feedback and Refine

Before launching your sales page, gather feedback from others. Whether it‚Äôs friends, colleagues, or professional contacts, fresh eyes will spot issues you might have missed.

**My Process**:
- I asked work buddies for feedback.
- One suggested adding a video, so I recorded a short video using Loom. It showed the benefits of my course, including time-stamped proof of how my protocol improved my writing speed.

Take this feedback, make adjustments, and get ready to launch.

## Day 6: Start Promoting

With your course and sales page ready, it‚Äôs time to spread the word. Use these strategies to promote effectively:
- Add the link to your social media bios.
- Write blog posts related to the problem your course solves.
- Send the link to your email list.
- Share it with friends and professional connections.

**Remember**: Consistent promotion is key to driving sales.
